# Linked List Exercise

Proposed by The Odin Project

Although in javascripts it is more practical to use arrays with their
traditional methods to manipulate the data in them, in this exercise what we
seek is to understand the way in which this data structure, linked list, works
logically.

## Requirements

- NodeJs
- npm

## Instalation

Use the following code:

```bash
npm install
```

## To take into account

The Node.js file is a class in the program code. It is totally different from
NodeJs, which is the platform in charge of executing javascripts on the
console.
